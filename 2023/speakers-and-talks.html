                Open source is rightfully popular, but succeeding may not be as easy as it sounds. In this talk, I'll highlight a number of common pitfalls that I have observed maintainers of a codebase create for themselves. I will go through why it might seem like a good idea, what harm it actually makes and how to repair mistakes and even better, how to avoid making them in the first place.

                Interoperability is a core element of the ongoing digitalisation. With the Interoperable Europe Act (IEA), the EU is aiming to create a dedicated legal framework on interoperability that to date has been non-binding. This talk will provide an overview of the state of play of the existing interoperability frameworks and guidelines in the EU, to then delve into the proposed IEA and the role of Free Software, from both an EU but also Member States perspective. We will take a closer look at some of the IEA’s loopholes and flaws that could undermine its goal of becoming the real game changer for an interoperable Europe.

                The OpenChain License Compliance (ISO/IEC 5230) and Security Assurance standards provide simple and effective ways for companies in the supply chain to improve open source software management. Organizations around the world have engaged with these standards over the last five years for cost reduction, time optimization and to allow staff to work on tasks directly related to improving products and services. Data suggests significant traction in adoption, with an example being a recent PwC-sponsored survey showing 20% of German companies with more than 2,000 employees using ISO/IEC 5230. This talk will explain how the OpenChain Project is building the support structures needs to accomplish ever broader market adoption, ranging from community activities to reference material to a commercial ecosystem. It will focus on recent developments, especially around expanding work in security, in editing the next generations of the standards, and in lessons learned to revise our supplier education material. Attendees will leave this talk knowing current options for assessment, deployment and - in the case of customer companies - encouraging suppliers to use these standards too.

                Web analytics technologies provide opportunities for organisations to obtain information about users visiting their websites in order to understand and optimise web usage. Use of such technologies often leads to issues related to data privacy and potential lock-in to specific suppliers and proprietary technologies. Use of open source software (OSS) for web analytics can create conditions for avoiding issues related to data privacy and lock-in, and thereby provides opportunities for a long-term sustainable solution for organisations both in the public and private sectors. This talk describes use of and engagement with OSS projects for web analytics. Specifically, the focus is on use of OSS licensed web analytics technologies in Swedish government authorities and on organisational engagement with the Matomo OSS project for web analytics. The talk also includes practitioner experiences and recommendations concerning use and provision of services related to Matomo.

                D-Bus is an IPC mechanism that is very ubiquitous on Linux desktop and embedded systems. It is the mechanism you'd use to communicate with many of the core Linux userspace subsystems, such as systemd, NetworkManager etc. Traditionally, most of these services have been written in C, a language known for its lack of safety.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                In the past years, Zeeshan has developed a library, called zbus for enabling implementation of D-Bus services and clients in a programming language designed for safety: Rust. While that is major step forward, the communication typically still happens through the D-Bus broker, which is written in C. A significant percentage of CVEs reported against the D-Bus brokers over the years could have been avoided if they were written in Rust. This is why Zeeshan has recently started working on writing a D-Bus broker in Rust, called dbuz.

                Abstract: Market concentration with a few dominant global providers of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions causes concern amongst competition authorities and public sector organisations which aim to maintain control of its data processing and long-term maintenance of digital assets. This imposes a range of technical and legal challenges, which in turn may inhibit opportunities for usage of FOSS. When a public sector organisation (PSO) acquires and uses a cloud-based SaaS solution, such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, this implies that data processing and maintenance of the organisation’s digital assets will be exposed to a range of different types of lock-in effects. For example, format lock-in causes technical and legal challenges which may prevent establishment of FOSS projects and impose risks for unlawful and inappropriate data processing. Further, two of the most talked about obstacles for use of US SaaS solutions are about to be addressed by the legislators: (1) by proposed revisions to the domestic Secrecy Act (SFS 2009:400) issued by the Swedish Government on 26 January 2023, and (2) by the EU commissions proposed adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework of 13 December 2022. Moreover, there are also several other factors which need to be assessed in order to conclude that data processing and maintenance of digital assets is lawful.

            <div class="abstract">
                Open Source Software (OSS) is today widely adopted as a means of collaboration and building commercial offerings and software supply-chains in the industry. Cost-sharing and open innovation, avoiding lock-ins, driving technological change, and establishing shared standards are commonly referred to as incentives, of which many also apply to Public Sector Organizations (PSOs). Yet, uptake and institutional capacity have thus far been limited and disproportionate to the potential upside in economic terms.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                Explanations may be found in PSOs’ dependence on acquiring and outsourcing technical capabilities and, by extension, their limited competency regarding OSS and software development. Additional challenges are implied by public procurement regulations and practices, which impact conditions for how PSOs can procure OSS. Symptomatic organizational barriers for PSOs, such as bureaucratic processes, short-term planning, and risk-aversive culture, further add to the mix.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                For municipalities, these challenges are accentuated due to their limited size and resources. However, so is the potential for collective action due to the type of public services they are required to provide. In Sweden, for example, we have 290 municipalities, all with the responsibility (among many) to provide elderly and daycare, school, and social services. As in industry, there is, hence, the potential for shared and standardized platforms and infrastructure, on which tailoring of specific needs can be applied in a modular structure.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk, we will look at previous and ongoing municipal collaborations in Sweden and on a European level and walk through both challenges, their consequences, and how they may be addressed and mitigated. The aim is to provide food for thought and practical advice for PSOs and software suppliers regarding how they can find a basis for a fruitful and mutually beneficial collaboration based on openness and transparency.

            <div class="abstract">
                Open Source Software (OSS) is today widely adopted as a means of collaboration and building commercial offerings and software supply-chains in the industry. Cost-sharing and open innovation, avoiding lock-ins, driving technological change, and establishing shared standards are commonly referred to as incentives, of which many also apply to Public Sector Organizations (PSOs). Yet, uptake and institutional capacity have thus far been limited and disproportionate to the potential upside in economic terms.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                Explanations may be found in PSOs’ dependence on acquiring and outsourcing technical capabilities and, by extension, their limited competency regarding OSS and software development. Additional challenges are implied by public procurement regulations and practices, which impact conditions for how PSOs can procure OSS. Symptomatic organizational barriers for PSOs, such as bureaucratic processes, short-term planning, and risk-aversive culture, further add to the mix.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                For municipalities, these challenges are accentuated due to their limited size and resources. However, so is the potential for collective action due to the type of public services they are required to provide. In Sweden, for example, we have 290 municipalities, all with the responsibility (among many) to provide elderly and daycare, school, and social services. As in industry, there is, hence, the potential for shared and standardized platforms and infrastructure, on which tailoring of specific needs can be applied in a modular structure.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk, we will look at previous and ongoing municipal collaborations in Sweden and on a European level and walk through both challenges, their consequences, and how they may be addressed and mitigated. The aim is to provide food for thought and practical advice for PSOs and software suppliers regarding how they can find a basis for a fruitful and mutually beneficial collaboration based on openness and transparency.

            <div class="abstract">
                Currently, when working with Apache Kafka® and Azure Databricks® (Apache Spark®), there is a built-in mechanism to transform Apache Avro® data to Apache Parquet® files. The issue with this approach, if we think in medallion lakehouse architecture, is that AVRO with nested data, will be persisted in a single PARQUET file in the bronze layer (full, raw and unprocessed history of each dataset) relying on ArrayType, MapType and StructType to represent the nested data. This will make it a bit more tedious to post-process data respectively in the following layers: silver (validated and deduplicated data) and gold (data as knowledge).
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                To avoid this issue, we present an open-source library, that will help transform AVRO, with nested data, to multiple PARQUET files where each of the nested data elements will be represented as an extension table (separate file). This will allow to merge both the bronze and silver layers (full, raw and history of each dataset combined with defined structure, enforced schemas as well validated and deduplicated data), to make it easier for data engineers/scientists and business analysts to combine data with already known logic (SQL joins).
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                As two of the medallion layers are being combined to a single, it might lead to the possible saving of a ⅓ in disk usage. Furthermore, since we aren't relying on a naive approach, when flattening and storing data, it could further lead to greater savings and a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach.

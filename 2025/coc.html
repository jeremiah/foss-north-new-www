<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>We, the organizers, want foss-north to be an event that is open and accessible
to all. We require all attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our
conference to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce
this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to
help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this can be directed to the e-mail found in the footer
of this page.</p>
<div class="bodybreak">&nbsp;</div>

<h2>Short Version</h2>
<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment
of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties,
Twitter and other online media.</p>
<p>This conference brings many people together in a relatively small area. To limit
the spread of contagious diseases, and to protect those with impaired immune
system, we ask that you stay home if you feel sick.</p>
<p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<h2>Full Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public
spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors
should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff
(including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or
badges.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security
or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues
and conference-related social events.</p>

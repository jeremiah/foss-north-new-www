                Software Heritage is an international project, supported by UNESCO, whose ambition is to collect, preserve, and share all software that is publicly available in source code form. On this foundation, a wealth of applications can be built, ranging from cultural heritage to industry and research.

            <div class="abstract">
                This reference archive and knowledge base for open source software constitute a worldwide development history, permanently archived in a uniform data model, including over 17 billion unique source files from over 270 million software projects, ~1.5PB (compressed) blobs, ~35 B nodes and ~500 B edges... that can be widely accessed by anyone.

                Storing and providing access to such a large amount of software represents a challenge that has required intensive research and innovation performed by SwH.

                SCANOSS operates in the Software Composition Analysis market, having a knowledge base related with all the published open source software as core product. It is a data company.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                Since its foundation, this organization had as key goal becoming an open source software company. Today, every software SCANOSS develops is published under open source licenses, including the software used by the company to build, enrich and maintain its knowledge base.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                Back in 2021, SCANOSS decided to start a journey towards open data. The first relevant action was to provide free (gratis) access to the subset of the knowledge base related with license compliance. They achieved it via the Software Transparency Foundation, helping license compliance engineers and lawyers all over the world to identify, analyse and curate open source software and their licenses, using SCANOSS or third party tools.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                Recognizing the growing demand from users to scrutinize their projects for known vulnerabilities, SCANOSS took a second step, publishing as open data its purl2cpe data-set, which today is becoming increasingly popular among security experts and release managers.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                This talk will describe these contributions as well as the lessons learned throughout this journey, going from open source software towards open data. SCANOSS's journey is far from done though. The company is taking further steps.

                A few weeks ago, a cryptography algorithm definitions data set was released as open data, aiming to improve and reach consensus around how companies perceive and manage the cryptography composition of their products. This new contribution, if collaboration around it flourish, has the potential to impact critical challenges that we have as industry in areas like Export Control (ECCN), product security, and quantum-readiness.

            <div class="abstract">
                During this talk, the speaker will also describe the lessons learned from this third step so far, the motivations to release this data set and next steps.

                A qualitative survey was conducted on a sample of 16 countries considered mature in their digital practices, as indicated through a set of digital maturity indicators. These countries were surveyed in terms of government policies, rationales, support mechanisms, means of promotion, and success stories related to software reuse. The surveyed countries exhibit diverse policies, emphasizing interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency. Economic arguments, interoperability, and transparency are prominent goals, while digital sovereignty varies. Security concerns are discussed, acknowledging both risks and benefits of OSS.

                In today's complex IT environments, it is more important than ever to automate tasks and processes. Event-Driven Ansible is a new feature of Ansible that allows you to automate IT tasks based on events that occur in your IT environment. This session will provide an introduction to Event-Driven Ansible, including what it is, how it works, and the benefits of using it. We will also discuss some examples of how Event-Driven Ansible can be used in real-world scenarios.

                R itself remains part of the GNU project, licensed under the GNU General Public License, and capable of running on many free operating systems, but it is increasingly becoming popular to include non-free software and services-as-software-substitutes in R environments. Moreover, these unethical practices are often obscured from useRs, and some users may not realize that they are running non-free software. I will introduce R and some of the common ways people use it, demonstrate the recent trends towards unethical practices in R, and comment on the dangers of such practices, for the individual and for society. Finally, I will inform of what we can do about these trends, both as individuals to protect ourselves, and as a group to further a free society.

                In the context of AI, we face a plethora of challenges that extend beyond the widely discussed performance scalability required to meet the growing demands of compute and storage in the latest models. These challenges encompass sustainability, pervasiveness, agility, and diversity, all of which are needed to cater to a constantly evolving range of applications and algorithms from endpoint to edge and cloud. In this talk, we explore how adaptive devices and agile compiler stacks can provide solutions by delivering post-production hardware specialization and co-designed algorithms. This results in highly optimized AI systems which not only provide the necessary performance scalability but also bring a reduction in carbon footprint while addressing the needs of a broad range of diverse applications with the necessary agility.

                The current approach to resolving dependencies (in package managers used by FOSS users) and handling vulnerable packages (in vulnerability management teams) is complex, tedious, and time-consuming. It's also a disconnected process when the development and security teams are not in sync. We can either determine if a package version is vulnerable, or we can resolve package versions for functional dependency requirements but without consideration for vulnerabilities - we cannot do both, and crossing both tools and organizational boundaries is difficult. We express dependency constraints as acceptable package version ranges, and vulnerabilities affect certain package version ranges. What if we resolve package dependencies by taking into consideration the vulnerable version ranges at the same time?

                In this talk, Philippe will share how non-vulnerable FOSS dependency resolution can resolve software package vulnerable version ranges and dependency version constraints at the same time. Developers can obtain a resolved package version graph matching the blended functional and vulnerability version constraints and get both non-vulnerable and up-to-date software code in a single resolution pass.

                The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive list of components in a piece of software. It is a crucial tool for understanding the composition of software, which is particularly important in the context of managing security risks and licensing compliance. Recent regulatory efforts like US's EO or EU's CRA explicitly move towards requiring SBOM for each software delivery. The System Package Data Exchange (SPDX) is a freely available ISO standard that provides a set of specifications for communicating SBOM information. It offers a common format for companies and organizations to share important data accurately and efficiently. This presentation will delve into the intricacies of SBOMs and the latest developments of SPDX, providing a comprehensive understanding of their importance in the software industry.

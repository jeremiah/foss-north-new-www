                <div class="abstract">
                    Chromium's process architecture has graphics access restricted to a separate GPU-process. There are several reasons why this could make sense, three common ones are: Security, Robustness and Dependency Separation.
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    GPU access restricted to a single process requires an efficient framework for communication over IPC from the other processes, and most likely a framework for composition of surfaces. This talk describes both the possible motivations for this kind of architecture and Chromium's solution for the IPC framework. We will demonstrate how a multiprocess program can compose into a single window on Linux.

                    Typically PRs are used as a means to communicate that some body of work has been done and is ready to be merged. But is this an optimal use of PRs? If we submit a PR after the work has been completed, have we missed a golden opportunity to collaborate?

                <div class="abstract">
                    PRs should be treated like the basic unit of collaboration within GitHub-based projects.

Although we might never find the answers, the pursuit of them provides us with the knowledge and skills our children need to survive.

                    The bug that could had sabotaged a year of work on Firefox didn't slip into production because of the efforts of engineers, program managers, and management to triage bugs. But how do you triage 9,000 bugs over the course of a three month release cycle and not burn out? How do you measure hotspots? And how do you make it sustainable? The Firefox team's bugmaster, Emma Humphries, reports on what one of the largest and longest-lived open source projects learned while building this milestone version of the beloved web browser.

                <div class="abstract">
                    We interviewed founders, developers and managers of 13 crowdfunding initiatives involving open source products to determine how communities, crowdfunding campaigns and open source are associated.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Our findings verified the existence of common characteristics among the cases, the emergence of a family-like relationship between the organizers and the community, as well as the community perceived as a success factor. We suggest that the development of certain niche products inherently leads to the adoption of open source as a licensing model and crowdfunding as the capital gathering process.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Software updates on embedded Linux devices has for a long time been a mess, consisting of "homegrown" solutions specific to a certain project and there was very little re-usage between projects and very little collaboration in our community to solve these complex problems. Luckily for us that time is over and the community around this topic has grown over last couple years and still is growing as the demand increases with the IoT revolution and OTA firmware updates (which introduces even more complexity).
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    There are now well established open-source solutions that have been "battle tested" that we can collaborate on to make the complexity of software updates manageable. We are heading for a time where a quality Board Support Package should provide an software update implementation because it really should be solved at this level instead of handing this over to application developers which have limited knowledge of low lever architecture on a embedded device.

                <div class="abstract">
                    In this talk Mirza will present some of the challenges of doing software updates on embedded system. He will also present the available open-source projects that help with solving these challenges. The projects are: SWupdate, Mender, RAUC, aktualizr (libostree) and resin.io.

                <div class="abstract">
                    In an age increasingly concerned with reducing bugs as well as complying with free software licenses, it is vitally important to thoroughly review audit any changes to the software that powers our technology and infrastructure.

                <div class="abstract">
                    However, existing tools to perform comparisons between two versions of a software package are overly-blunt instruments, either providing too much output or none at all. Binaries such as firmware images or precompiled executables are especially problematic: a single change in the source is presented as a meaningless stream of changes, offering no insight into potentially critical bugs. And these are often precisely the files we care most about…!

                <div class="abstract">
                    Diffoscope is different. Developed as part of the Reproducible Builds effort, it gets to the bottom of what makes files truly different. It recursively unpacks archives of all kinds and transforms various formats into human-readable forms for display. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, etc. just as easily.

                <div class="title">Atari ST Free Operating Systems</div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    The Atari ST was released in 1985, with a simple but efficient operating system: TOS. Later, a multitasking kernel named MiNT was adopted by Atari, and finally released as Free Software under the name FreeMiNT. GCC was ported to FreeMiNT and allowed to compile many other GNU software for the Atari platform. Emulators appeared in the '90s. As Atari TOS is still non-Free, independent developers created EmuTOS: a Free TOS clone based on open-sourced components. GCC was later upgraded to newer versions, and ready-to-use binaries of the cross-compiler were made available for Ubuntu, Cygwin, and more. This brought a new impulse to the platform. EmuTOS and FreeMiNT are still actively developed nowadays. They have been improved over the ages, and extended to support special features of emulators as well as extra hardware. They even support non-Atari hardware, such as Amiga and ColdFire processor. Moreover, development environment has been modernized to use GitHub facilities and Travis CI for automatic builds. This is a good example to see how modern tools can advantageously be used for development on old platforms.

                    Vincent Rivière has always loved computers, and the Atari ST was his first own one in 1992. He learned a lot on that machine, specially assembly language and operating system internals. Then he studied Unix and Windows development in C/C++. He worked as software engineer in several companies. Later, he became interested in cross-development, and came back to the Atari ST as training target. He ported old GCC patches to newer compiler versions, and that was the starting point of new adventures with contemporary Atari communities. Especially, he was the project manager of EmuTOS between 2010 and 2015. EmuTOS is a Free operating system compatible with the original Atari one. Combined to the FreeMiNT multitasking kernel, it extends Atari-like operating systems to unsuspected levels, such as support for GNU/Linux software and exotic hardware.

                <div class="abstract">
                    The first thing that jumps to one's mind when someone mentions "pooling" in the context of media codecs is usually patents. Alliance of Open Media's first codec, AV1 breaks this stereotype by actually pooling *contributors*, as it consolidates the best parts, ideas and developer talent of Google's AV9/AV10, Cisco's Thor and Xiph's Daala codecs into a royalty-free and open source video codec that's not only supported by several other industry giants like Microsoft, Netflix and Apple, but is set to even beat the top-of-the-line (and patent-encumbered) HEVC codec in compression ratio. Mozilla Research has been a contributor to the development of Daala for years now and as AV1 shapes up to be the open and free codec the Internet always deserved (and one Mozilla has been fighting for) the Emerging Technologies division have further upped the stakes. As developing a cutting-edge codec requires cutting-edge technologies, Mozilla's ET division has been working on various, distributed browser-based tools to ease collaboration and hasten the solidification of such a diverse codebase.

                <div class="abstract">
                    In the talk I will introduce AV1, what industry dynamics contributed to its inception and how Mozilla has developed and employed several, in-browser tools, incorporating bleeding-edge technologies like Emscripten-compiled library modules in ASM.js and WebAssembly to help the contributors iterate and bugfix newer versions of the bitstream itself, as well as the encoder and decoder.
